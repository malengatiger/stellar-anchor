    ðŸŽ½ ðŸŽ½ Explanation
    Where possible we use field names from schema.org. Words are separated with underlines as that convention has previously been established in Stellar protocols.

    ðŸ¥¦ Addresses
    Address formatting varies widely from country to country and even within each country.
    See here for details. Rather than attempting to create a field for each possible part of an address in every country,
    this protocol takes a middle of the road approach. Address fields that are fairly universal can be encoded with the country_code,
    state_or_province, city, and postal_code fields.

    Full addresses, however, should be encoded as a single multi-line string in the address field.
    This allows any address in the world to be represented with a limited number of fields.
    If address parsing is necessary, parsing will be easier since the country, city, and postal code are already separate fields.
